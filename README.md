# My Fortran Learning Journey

Welcome to my Fortran learning journey! This repository is a collection of the Fortran programs and projects I'm working on as part of my school course. As I explore the world of Fortran programming, I'll be sharing my progress and code here.

## About This Repository

- **Learning**: You'll find a variety of Fortran code examples, assignments, and projects that I've completed while learning Fortran in school.

- **Documentation**: Each code snippet and project may include a README file with explanations and usage instructions.

- **Progress**: I'll be updating this repository regularly to reflect my growth as a Fortran programmer.

Feel free to explore the code, offer feedback, or even collaborate if you're also interested in Fortran! I'm excited to share my Fortran journey with you.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Fortran or interested in learning, you can start by checking out the code in this repository. Feel free to open issues, make suggestions, or provide feedback. Let's learn and grow together!

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the repository structure:

- `/projects`: Houses more extensive Fortran projects and programs.
- `/code-samples`: Includes smaller code snippets and examples to illustrate specific concepts.

## Getting in Touch
